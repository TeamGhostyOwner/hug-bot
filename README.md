# Hug Bot
Especially in the time of COVID-19, it's been hard to stay in touch with friends, and easy to get depressed. This discord bot allows you to send and recieve virtual hugs with cute gifs. Sending a hug to your friend is a fun way to make their day, as well as to stay in touch!

Add it to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=789552439292067842&permissions=10240&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Fapi%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize&scope=bot)!

If you need more info or have a question, check out the discord server [here](https://discord.gg/yfu7mVbJpU), but know that I'm pretty much the only person on there.

# How To Use
Use **!hug @mention to hug a friend!** As of now, you can only hug one friend at a time; you cannot hug an entire role.

Hug bot will then send a message and a hugging gif.

# Why This?
You might be wondering why you need to add a seperate bot just for hugs, instead of just using **owo hug**. This hug bot is essential to your server because it adds a cute gif and comment, instead of just **person a hugs person b**. The gif and comment make the hug way more wholesome, cute, and exciting! It also uses a person's nickname, not their username, which is essential in servers where people have nicknames.

# Credits
All programming is by me, and all of the gifs are from *milk and mocha* or *peach and goma*.
